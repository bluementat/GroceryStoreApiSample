# Overview
This repository contains a very simple sample of a Grocery Store API Solution. At this time, the API only provides endpoints for access to Customer data which only contains ID's and Names. THis data is provided through an in-memory database abstract with a repository. For later development, an IGroceryStoreRepository interface is provided to allow other data sources as well as an expansion of the data provided.
