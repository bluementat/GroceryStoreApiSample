# Overview
This repository contains a simple Grocery Store API Solution. At this time, the API only provides endpoints for access to Customer data which only contains ID's and Names. This data is provided by an in-memory database abstracted with a repository design pattern. For later development, an IGroceryStoreRepository interface is provided to allow other data sources as well as an expansion of the data provided.

Note - The solution does not include authentication OAuth/OIDC at this time.
